# WDI_PROJECT_2


DANCEOKE


This is my second project for my WDI course at General Assembly. This is a one week individual project, and concluded a one week introduction to Ruby on Rails.

The parameters for the project were:

    -A working full-stack application
    -Use a minimum of 2 modelsâ€“ a user model, and one that represents the main resource for the app.
    -Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
    -Have complete RESTful routes for at least one resource with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
    -Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with the relationally-stored data.
    -Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
    -Be deployed online and accessible to the public
    -Should use Bower to manage any dependencies


My goals:

    -Fully utilize RESTful routes and relationship models.
    -Incorporate javascript for front end functionality and improved design.
    -Explore new gems for Rails.
    -Make a responsive, useable app.
